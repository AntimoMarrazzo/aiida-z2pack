# aiida-z2pack

This repository contains AiiDA workflows and software tools for high-throughput computational topological materials discovery, with a focus on 2D topological insulators.
The repository contains the Z2pack AiiDA plugin and the TopologicalWorkflow (both compatible with AiiDA v0.10.0 or less), in addition to the plugin for bands.x, a modified version of the bands.x code and the PwWorkflow
The calculation of topological invariants supports Quantum ESPRESSO only.

### How do I get set up? ###

The Topological Workflow has the following code dependencies:
..*Z2pack plugin 	         	(by Antimo Marrazzo, THEOS & NCCR MARVEL, EPFL)
..*PWworkflow      	     	    (by Nicola Mounet, THEOS & NCCR MARVEL, EPFL - now at CERN)
..*(optional) Bands.x plugin 	(by Davide Campi, THEOS & NCCR MARVEL, EPFL)

### Contribution guidelines ###

..*Never commit to the master branch!
..*Fork a devel branch for your sub-project and commit there
