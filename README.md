# aiida-z2pack

This repository contains AiiDA workflows and software tools for high-throughput computational topological materials discovery, with a focus on 2D topological insulators.
The repository contains the Z2pack AiiDA plugin and the TopologicalWorkflow (both compatible with AiiDA v9.0 or less), in addition to the plugin for bands.x, a modified version of the bands.x code and the PwWorkflow
The calculation of topological invariants supports Quantum ESPRESSO nly.

### How do I get set up? ###

The Topological Workflow needs:
-Z2pack plugin 	         	(by Antimo Marrazzo, THEOS, EPFL)
-PWworkflow      		(by Nicola Mounet, THEOS, EPFL - now at CERN)
-(optional) Bands.x plugin 	(by Davide Campi, THEOS, EPFL)

### Contribution guidelines ###

-Never commit to the master branch!
-Fork a devel branch for your sub-project and commit there

### Who do I talk to? ###
Contact of repository owner : Antimo Marrazzo (THEOS,EPFL), antimo.marrazzo@epfl.ch
